# Gratuity-Calculator
Gratuity calculator for restaurants. This was a group project for a restaurant in Sunnyvale. Our goal was to make the employees' 
lifes easier by calculating gratuity and also having the distribution of tips to all employees.

This project taught us how to use Django's framework as a backend and having a functional frontend using Javascript that calculates in real time.
